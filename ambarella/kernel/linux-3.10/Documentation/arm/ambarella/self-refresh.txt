Introduction
============

The kernel supports up to four system sleep states generically.
From shallowest to deepest, they are:
1) freeze:   Suspend-To-Idle / ACPI S0
2) standby:  Standby / Power-On Suspend / ACPI S1
3) mem:      Suspend-To-RAM / Self-Refresh / STR / ACPI S3
4) disk:     Suspend-To-Disk / STD / ACPI S4

For details, pelase see Documentation/powr/states.txt

Here we just talk about "mem", i.e., Self-Refresh (abbreviated as SR).

In short words, when system is in SR, all the HWs except for DRAM and PWC are
powered off.



SR and DRAM
============

At present we can support SR with DDR3 and LPDDR3, other DRAM types are not
tested, yet.

One of the differences between DDR3 and LPDDR3 is that DDR3 has a "RESET" pin
while LPDDR3 doesn't have. When entering into SR, the "RESET" pin must be pulled
high. Unfortunately, when in SR state, the SoC will be powered off and pull the
the "RESET" pin low, so we have to add a workaround with the help of HW design,
i.e., using a GPIO to control the triode to cut off the "RESET" signal to DRAM.

Different boards design may use different GPIO, and both BST and Kernel need to
know which GPIO is used to cut off the "RESET" signal.
1) For BST, we define the GPIO in .ini file by "DRAM_RESET_CTRL_GPIO",
   please see "ini" section below.
2) For Kernel, we define the GPIO in .dts file by "ambarella,dram-reset-ctrl",
   please see "Device Tree" section below.

Note:
  Although LPDDR3 doesn't have the "RESET" pin, you also need to define the GPIO
  in .ini file, because this GPIO definition, i.e., "DRAM_RESET_CTRL_GPIO", also
  acts as another role, that is, tell BST to support SR.
  In other words, if "DRAM_RESET_CTRL_GPIO" is NOT defined in .ini file, BST will
  boot system directly, but not check if it's cold boot or resume from SR when
  powered on.
  For LPDDR3, you can define "DRAM_RESET_CTRL_GPIO" as any meaningful GPIO as
  long as this GPIO does not affect system booting.

[!!!IMPORTANT!!!]
  IF SELF-REFRESH IS NOT USED, "DRAM_RESET_CTRL_GPIO" MUST BE REMOVED FROM .ini
  FILE, OTHERWISE SYSTEM MAY NOT BOOT UP OR REBOOT SUCCESSFULLY.



SR and PWC (Power Control)
==========================

SR must co-work with PWC, and there are two options to use PWC:
1) internal PWC, but not all SoCs have internal PWC
2) external PWC (MCU)
PS: for those SoCs without internal PWC, you have to use external MCU.

If the board design is to use external MCU for power sequence control, the SoC
needs to communicate with the MCU through a GPIO, and the protocol is:
1) SoC keeps the GPIO high 100ms to notify MCU to enter self-refresh. After
100ms, SoC should keep the GPIO low.
2) MCU notifies SoC the state after powered up:
2.1) if cold boot, MCU keeps the GPIO high.
2.2) if resume from SR, MCU keeps the GPIO low.

Different boards design may use different GPIO, and both BST and Kernel need to
know which GPIO is used to communicate with the external MCU.
1) For BST, we define the GPIO in .ini file by "MCU_NOTIFY_GPIO",
   please see "ini" section below.
2) For Kernel, we define the GPIO in .dts file by "ambarella,gpio-notify-mcu",
   please see "Device Tree" section below.

Note:
  It's allowed to either use two separate GPIOs or use one GPIO to communicate
  between SoC and MCU, it's determined by the MCU firmware.



Driver Configuration
====================

Power management options  --->
         [*] Suspend to RAM and standby
         [*] User space wakeup sources interface
         (100) Maximum number of user space wakeup sources (0 = no limit)
         -*- Device power management core functionality



Device Tree
===========

Please see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/ambarella.txt
               -> 2) - Informational node -> ii) /chosen



ini
===

In .ini file, there are two fields related to SR:

1) "DRAM_RESET_CTRL_GPIO", e.g., <DRAM_RESET_CTRL_GPIO value="5"/>
   No matter DDR3 or LPDDR3, this field has to be set as long as SR is used.
   Please see the "Note" in "SR and DRAM" section.

2) "MCU_NOTIFY_GPIO", e.g., <MCU_NOTIFY_GPIO value="33"/>
   This filed need to be set only when external MCU is used. If using internal
   PWC, this filed must NOT be set.



Usage
=====

1) Entering into SR
root@/#echo mem > /sys/power/state

2) Resume from SR by power button
Press the button directly

3) Resume from SR by RTC
root@/#echo enabled > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/device/power/wakeup
root@/#rtcwake -s 10 -m mem
PS: 
  a) this is available only when using internal PWC.
  b) rtc,wakeup has to be added into rtc node in DTS.
